Peak Wellness 
================

A Website for a company offering Massage, Pilates, Personal Training, Acupuncuture and more. This website is designed to give users an overview of the services available and direct them to contact the trainer to book sessions.

UX
------------------------

The website is designed to entice users with the home page and help them quickly zero in on the services they want to use and how they can book them.

* A User can be directed to the page in a variety of ways, including online search or by the user's social media channels.
* Once there they are presented with an inspirational message and directed to the Services page with a button to 'begin their journey' - alternatively they have the full options avaiable to them on the Nav bar if they have visited befor or know what they are looking for.
* On the Services page they are shown the basic services offered and directed to Book Now - this button will take them to the Contact page where they can contact the client to book an appointment.
* If they are browsing various optoins they can view the pricelist page from any page using the nav link at the top of all pages, this will take them to the prices page which will give them a more detailed breakdown of all the times and services available.

As part of this design process I used [Figma](https://www.figma.com) to structure the layout of the site and the pages. The design process changed many of the ideas.

Technologies Used

Testing
--------------

I tested the functionality of the site myself manually throughout the devlopment, ensuring that features were working before moving on or pushing them.

The client was consulted on a regular basis to ensure that the functionality was as they wished.

I received feedback from a key demographic of the client, testing the website with a focus group of men and women in the 20-29 age bracked. From this feedback I added the pricelist page as they advised that this would be important functionality for them when browsing their options.

I also consulted a group of women in the 50+ age bracket to ensure that the site was accessible to them and they were able to navigate intuitively.


Deployment
-------------------


The site is deployed [here](geminerald.github.io/peakwellness "Peak Wellness page on GitHub Pages").

After the site was close to it's final stage it was deplayed to GitHub Pages in order to allow for more available real world testing with a varitey of users. 

Development continued, pushing to master branch once I was confident in the code used would increase functionality or users experience.
