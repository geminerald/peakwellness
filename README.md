Peak Wellness 
================

A Website for a company offering Massage, Pilates, Personal Training, Acupuncuture and more. This website is designed to give users an overview of the services available and direct them to contact the trainer to book sessions.

UX
------------------------

The website is designed to entice users with the home page and help them quickly zero in on the services they want to use and how they can book them.

As part of this design process I used Figma to structure the layout of the site and the pages. The design process changed many of the ideas.

Deployment
-------------------


The site is deployed [here](geminerald.github.io/peakwellness "Peak Wellness page on GitHub").

After the site was close to it's final stage it was deplayed to GitHub Pages in order to allow for more available real world testing with a varitey of users. 

Development continued, pushing to master branch once I was confident in the code used would increase functionality or users experience.
